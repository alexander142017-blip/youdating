## Contributing

If you want to contribute:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Make your changes and add tests if applicable
4. Commit and push, then open a PR

Please ensure:
- The project builds locally (`npm run build`) before opening a PR.
- Tests (if any) pass.

## Troubleshooting / Notes

- On macOS the filesystem can be case-insensitive. Make sure component filenames match their import casing (e.g., `App.jsx` vs `app.jsx`) â€” CI runners on Linux are case-sensitive and will fail if casing doesn't match.
- If a workflow needs to create branches/PRs, ensure the workflow permissions include:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
```
and that `actions/checkout@v3` uses `persist-credentials: true` when pushing with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
