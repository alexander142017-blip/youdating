## Example: Build Failure Scenario

If a build fails for a specific PR, the output would look like:

```bash
[INFO] =========================================
[INFO] Processing PR #5
[INFO] =========================================
[INFO] Step 1: Checking out PR #5...
[INFO] Checked out branch: copilot/remove-base44-sdk-replace-supabase
[INFO] Step 2: Creating new branch rules-update/pr-5...
[INFO] Step 3: Applying repository rules updates...
[SUCCESS] Rules updates applied successfully
[INFO] Step 4: Staging and committing changes...
[SUCCESS] Changes committed
[INFO] Step 5: Running npm ci and npm run build...
[ERROR] npm run build failed for PR #5

[INFO] =========================================
[INFO] RESULTS SUMMARY
[INFO] =========================================

PR #5 - https://github.com/alexander142017-blip/youdating/pull/5
  State: failed
  Failing step: npm run build
  Error output:
    > youdating@0.0.0 build
    > vite build
    
    vite v7.1.11 building for production...
    ‚úì 1844 modules transformed.
    x Build failed in 1.52s
    error during build:
    [vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "@/components/InvalidComponent" from "src/pages/SomePage.jsx".
    This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
    
    [... more error details ...]
```

In this case:
- The branch `rules-update/pr-5` remains local (not pushed)
- The error details are captured and reported
- Processing continues with the next PR
- The user can manually investigate and fix the issue

## Example: Skipped PR Scenario

If a PR is already closed or doesn't exist:

```bash
[INFO] =========================================
[INFO] Processing PR #15
[INFO] =========================================
[WARNING] PR #15 is not open (state: CLOSED)

[INFO] =========================================
[INFO] RESULTS SUMMARY
